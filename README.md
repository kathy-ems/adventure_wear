# Adventure Wear

## Be Prepared For The Elements On your Next Adventure ##
<!--Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.-->
For adventure loving folks who wish there was an app that told them what to wear for it.

_"No more staring at your wardrobe wondering if you will be over dressed or under dressed for the weather conditions!"_  - Kathy creator of Ready For Adventure 
<!-- A quote from a spokesperson in your company.-->

<!--## Summary ##-->
Adventure Wear gives you customized data on what you wore previously and makes suggestions on what you should wear for your next adventure, whether it's biking, running, swimming, kayaking or hiking.

<!--## Problem > Describe the problem your product solves. ##-->
There is not a 'what to wear' app out there that will allow you to personalize your wardrobe (because you know how much you love that blue shirt), and customize the suggestions based on individual needs, because some people have higher or lower tolerances for weather conditions.

<!--## Solution  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem. ##-->
Provides a customized 'wardrobe', where you 'hang' that favorite shirt in and tag it with the perfect weather conditions for that shirt and the appropriate activity for that shirt. Then later, you open the app, select which activity you are going to perform and it will tell you the current weather conditions and if they match that shirt, then it will suggest wearing that shirt!

## How to Get Started ##
Open the app and select the current weather and your activity. Choose an outfit and get out the door!
<!-- Describe how easy it is to get started.-->

## Customer Quote ##
_"This is the hidden gem for anyone who is active and enjoys the outdoors and wants to be comfortable while doing the activities they love."_ - Sally from Colorado
<!-- Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.-->


<!--## Closing and Call to Action ##-->
It's time to get out the door and on with your adventure!
